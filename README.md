# The Tetris Bit Matrix

This is the Tetris Bit Matrix project, or the "Tetris Bitboard" project (taking its name from the [bitbaords of Chess programming](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards), in which I try to establish a C library for Tetris matrix manipulation using bit-level operators. This low-level optimization will allow AI projects to simulate Tetris games with higher computational efficiency than other methods, and should dramatically increase model training speed. Additionally, I am documenting the entire process as I go, starting with the [basics](https://github.com/professor-l/bitboard/blob/master/docs/BASICS.md). For a full list of the completed write-ups, see below:
